# Transformers_NLP

Transformers have revolutionized Natural Language Processing (NLP) by introducing a groundbreaking architecture that excels in capturing contextual relationships in textual data. Originally introduced in the paper "Attention is All You Need" by Vaswani et al., transformers have become the de facto architecture for various NLP tasks. While exploring NLP, I applied transformers by leveraging pre-trained models and incorporating them into my learning process. This involved hands-on experience with transformer-based models such as BERT, GPT, and T5. I utilized these models for tasks like machine translation, sentiment analysis, and text generation, witnessing firsthand their ability to handle complex language structures and nuances.
